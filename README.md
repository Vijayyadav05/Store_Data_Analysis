# Store_Data_Analysis

## Project Overview:
This dashboard is a visual representation of key sales and order metrics for a store called Vrinda Store. The focus is on analyzing sales trends, demographic distribution, order status, and geographical insights to evaluate store performance.

## Objectives:

1) Analyze Monthly Orders and Sales:
  Understand the trends in order count and revenue over the months.
2) Compare Sales by Gender:
  Evaluate the distribution of sales between men and women.
3) Order Status Tracking:
  Identify the proportion of orders delivered, refunded, returned, and canceled.
4) Sales by Age Group:
  Understand which age groups contribute the most to total sales.
5) Geographical Insights:
  Identify the top states driving the most revenue.
6) Category and Channel Insights:
  Provide filters to further analyze specific product categories, states, and channels.

## Findings:
1) Monthly Orders and Sales:

Trend: There is a fluctuating trend in both order counts and sales across the year, with a noticeable drop in the last quarter.

Peak Sales: May and June seem to have the highest order volumes, potentially due to seasonal demand.

2) Sales by Gender:

Women account for 64% of sales, significantly higher than men, indicating a higher engagement from female customers.

3) Order Status:

Delivered Orders: A large percentage (92%) of orders are successfully delivered.

Refunds, Returns, and Cancellations: These account for smaller percentages but may require improvement in customer satisfaction to reduce cancellations and returns.

4) Sales by Age Group:

Adults (50%) contribute the most to sales, followed by Teenagers (30%). Senior sales are relatively lower (20%).

5) Top States:

Maharashtra leads with the highest sales (2.98M), followed by Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu.

These top states drive significant revenue, suggesting focus areas for marketing and inventory planning.

## Conclusion:

Women and Adults are the key customer demographics driving most of the sales, indicating that marketing strategies could be tailored towards them.

Seasonal fluctuations affect sales, with peaks observed in the middle of the year. This suggests the need for more consistent promotional campaigns to maintain sales volume throughout the year.

Maharashtra and Karnataka are significant contributors to sales, and additional efforts could be focused on boosting sales in other regions.

## Recommendations:

1) Customer Engagement: Focus on retention strategies for female and adult customers while exploring opportunities to increase engagement from other demographics like seniors.
   
2) Geographic Expansion: Consider strategies to further expand and improve sales in states like Tamil Nadu and Telangana.
   
3) Product Analysis: Utilize filters on categories and channels to investigate underperforming products or regions and optimize inventory management accordingly.
